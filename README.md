# Mini3DPhysics

Tiny 3D physics engine inspired by the book "Game Physics Cookbook" by Gabor Szauer.

The engine computes everything but does not render the scene.

The relevant chapters of the book are summarized in the pages below.

The interactive demos are rendered independently with [W.js](https://xem.github.io/W)

# Engine source code
