<title>Ch.2 & 3: Matrices and matrix transformations</title>
<h1>Chapter 2: Matrices</h1>
<p>→ Source code: <a href="../lib/matrix.js">matrix.js</a>.

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A matrix is a 2D grid of numbers (2x2 to 4x4) representing a transformation.
<p>They can be combined or applied to vectors using multiplication.
<p>Our library will represent matrices with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMMatrix/DOMMatrix">DOMMatrix</a>.
<p><code>m = new DOMMatrix([
  m11, m12, m13, m14,
  m21, m22, m23, m24,
  m31, m32, m33, m34,
  m41, m42, m43, m44
]);</code>

<h2>Transpose</h2>
<p>Transposing a matrix inverts its horizontal and vertical axis.
                      
<p><code class=f>      [A B C                   [A D G
M = D E F            M<sup>T</sup> = B E H
       G H I]                     C F I]</code>
<p>It's not present in DOMMatrix, and usually doesn't need to be implemented.

<h2>Multiplication</h2>
<p>Matrices multiplication is not commutative (applied from right to left).
<p>It is equal to a system of linear equations.
<p>The product of two matrices represents the product of each column of the first one with each line of the second one.
<p><code>mn = m.multiply(n);</code>

<h2>Identity matrix</h2>
<p>The identity matrix doesn't change the element multiplied by it.
<p><code>m = new DOMMatrix();</code>

<h2>Determinant, matrix of minors, cofactor, adjugate</h2>
<p>These operations are used to determine the inverse of a matrix and don't need to be detailed here.

<h2>Matrix inverse</h2>
<p>Multiplying a matrix m by its inverse m<sup>-1</sup> gives the identity matrix.
<p>Not every matrix has an inverse.
<p><code>mi = m.inverse();</code>

<h1>Chapter 3: matrix transformations</h1>

<h2>Matrix majors</h2>
<p>Row major or column major consists in choosing conceptually how the rotation and translation are stored in a 4x4 matrix, horizontally or vertically.
<p>The book chooses row major, but most WebGL uses column major, so we will use the latter from now on.
<p>The rows and column majors matrices are the transposed of each other.
<p>A 4x4 matrix in column major contains rotation information on its top-left 3x3 submatrix, translation information on the right column and scale information on the diagonal.

<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>Translation describes how an object moves on each axis. It is stored in m14, m24 and m34.
<p><code>t = m.translate(x, y, z);</code>

<h2>Scaling</h2>
<p>Scaling represents the object's scale on each axis. It is stored in m11, m22 and m33, but these components are shared with rotation.
<p><code>s = m.scale(x, y, z); // scale around the origin
s = m.scale(x, y, z, ox, oy, oz); // scale around the point o</code>

<h2>How rotations work</h2>
<p>Euler rotations consist in applying rotations sequentially:
<p>- Pitch (rotation around the X axis)
<p>- Yaw (rotation around the Y axis)
<p>- Roll (rotation around the Z axis)
<p><code>r = m.rotate(x, y, z);</code>
<p>Gimbal lock happens when two axis get merged (ex: pitch at 90° then yaw at 90°), and can be solved by using Axis-angle or Quaternion rotations instead.

<h2>Rotation matrices</h2>
<p>A 3x3 matrix (or submatrix) represents rotations, encoded in the following way:

<p><b>Warning:</b> in DOMMatrix methods, angles are given in degrees, not radians.

<h2>Axis-angle rotation</h2>
<p>Instead of describing a rotation around X, Y and Z axis, it is defined as an unique rotation around a custom, oriented axis.
<p><code>r = m.rotateAxisAngle(x, y, z, angle);</code>

<h2>Vector-matrix multiplication</h2>
<p>Matrices are useful to apply transformation to vectors, with a multiplication.
<p>Multiplying a 4x4 matrix with a vector highlights the importance of the w component:
<p>- With directions, w = 0, so these vectors are immune to translations whrn multiplied with the 4th column of the matrix.
<p>- With points, w = 1 (or any value different than 0), so these vectors can be translated.
<p><code>t = m.transformPoint(v);</code>

<h2>Transform matrix</h2>
<p>In games, matrices usually perform scale first, rotate second and translate last.

<h2>View matrix</h2>
<p>To render 3D scenes on a 2D screen, vertices (3D points) get transformed to appear correctly in the field of view.
<p>- World transform computes the local point coordinates in world coordinates
<p>- View transform puts it in eye space (or view space or camera space)
<p>- Projection puts it into normalized device coordinates.

<h2>Projection matrix</h2>
<p>Projection can be in perspective or orthographic.
<p><img src="proj.png" width=600>
<p>Where:
<p>- fov: field of view angle (usually 60° or π/3 rad)
<br>- width, height: canvas size
<br>- aspect: canvas aspect ratio (width/height)
<br>- Z<sub>f</sub>, Z<sub>n</sub>: far and near clipping planes
<br>- cot = 1 / tan.
